# Sleep Calculator

Calculate when to go to sleep or wake up based on sleep cycles.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS, Vite

I wanted to learn more about TypeScript and React. I set out to create a minimalistic, open-source alternative to a website I use frequently, [sleepyti.me](https://sleepyti.me).

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to implement TypeScript into a React app, and types associated with React.
